# barcodeReader
I Asked ChatGPT simple question (Can you create simple angular application which will read bar codes via camera?) and this is what we created together.

Here is ChatGPT answer:
## Angular Application for Reading Barcodes via Camera

It is possible to create a simple Angular application that can read barcodes via a camera. Angular is a front-end web development framework, so it can be used to create applications that run in a web browser. To read barcodes via a camera, the application will need to use a barcode reader library, such as QuaggaJS or ZBar, and access the device's camera through the browser's JavaScript API.

### How to Create the Application

To create an Angular application that can read barcodes via a camera, you will need to have the following tools installed:

- Node.js: a JavaScript runtime that is used to run and manage the Angular application
- Angular CLI: a command-line interface that is used to generate and manage Angular projects
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing code

Once you have these tools installed, follow these steps:

1. Use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project by running the following command:
```bash
ng new my-barcode-app
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and start the development server by running the following command:
```bash
cd my-barcode-app
ng serve
```

3. Open the project in your text editor or IDE and add the barcode reader library to your project. For example, if you are using QuaggaJS, you can add it by running the following command:
```bash
npm install quagga
```

4. In the src/app directory, create a new component for the barcode reader. You can do this using the Angular CLI by running the following command:
```bash
ng generate component barcode-reader
```

5. In the barcode-reader component, use the navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() method to access the device's camera and display a live video feed on the page. You can do this by adding the following code to the component's template file (barcode-reader.component.html):
```javascript
<video #videoElement></video>
```

6. In the component's class file (barcode-reader.component.ts), import the barcode reader library and initialize it to read barcodes from the video feed. You can do this by adding the following code to the component:
```javascript
import Quagga from 'quagga';

@Component({...})
export class BarcodeReaderComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild('videoElement') videoElement: ElementRef;

  ngOnInit() {
    Quagga.init({
      inputStream: {
        type: 'LiveStream',
        target: this.videoElement.nativeElement,
      },
      decoder: {
        readers: ['code_128_reader']
      }
    }, (error) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return;
      }
      Quagga.start();
    });
  }
}

```

7. Add the BarcodeReaderComponent to the root component (app.component.html) to make it visible on the page:
```javascript
<app-barcode-reader></app-
```
